    <h1>This is The First Header</h1>
    <h3>This Information is almost as important as the first header.</h3>
    <h6>This is More Of a Subtitle Really</h6>
        <main>
    Here is a paragraph of information. <br> It goes under the headers and the text 
    should be much smaller than the H1 and H3 header <br>This part will have more specifics 
    that pertain to what information that the headers contain. <br> I really do hope this website
    is both fun and informative.
