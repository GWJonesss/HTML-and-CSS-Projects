    <h3><span style=font-style:italic;font-weight:Bold;font-size:20px>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.</span><br> 
    &nbsp;Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the<br>
    &nbsp;ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down<br>
    &nbsp;on or to eat: it was a hobbit­hole, and that means comfort.<br>
    &nbsp;It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob<br>
    &nbsp;in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube­shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable<br>
    &nbsp;tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished<br>
    &nbsp;chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats ­ the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel<br>
    &nbsp;wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill ­ The Hill, as all the<br>
    &nbsp;people for many miles round called it ­ and many little round doors opened out of it, first on<br>
    &nbsp;one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars,<br>
    &nbsp;pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens,<br>
    &nbsp;dining­rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms<br>
    &nbsp;were all on the left­hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows,<br>
    &nbsp;deep­set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the<br>
    &nbsp;river.<br>
    <section>
    <span style=font-style:italic;font-weight:Bold;font-size:20px>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hobbit was a very well­to­do hobbit, and his name was Baggins.</span> <br>
    &nbsp;The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very<br>
    &nbsp;respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any<br>
    &nbsp;adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any<br>
    &nbsp;question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure,<br>
    &nbsp;found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the<br>
    &nbsp;neighbours' respect, but he gained­well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.<br>
    &nbsp;The mother of our particular hobbit … what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some<br>
    &nbsp;description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us.<br>
    &nbsp;They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves.<br>
    &nbsp;Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday<br>
    &nbsp;sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me<br>
    &nbsp;come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are<br>
    &nbsp;inclined to be at in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear<br>
    &nbsp;no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the<br>
    &nbsp;stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good­natured faces, and<br>
    &nbsp;laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can<br>
    &nbsp;get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit ­ of<br>
    &nbsp;Bilbo Baggins, that is ­ was the fabulous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable<br>
    &nbsp;daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that<br>
    &nbsp;ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took<br>
    &nbsp;ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was<br>
    &nbsp;still something not entirely hobbit­like about them, ­ and once in a while members of the<br>
    &nbsp;Took­clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed<br>
    &nbsp;it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though<br>
    &nbsp;they were undoubtedly richer. Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she<br>
    &nbsp;became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious<br>
    &nbsp;hobbit­hole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or<br>
    &nbsp;over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is<br>
    &nbsp;probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition<br>
    &nbsp;of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his makeup from the Took<br>
    &nbsp;side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until<br>
    &nbsp;Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful<br>
    &nbsp;hobbit­hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact<br>
    &nbsp;apparently settled down immovably.<br>

    <span style=font-style:italic;font-weight:Bold;font-size:20px>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world,</span><br>
    &nbsp;when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo<br>
    &nbsp;Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that<br>
    &nbsp;reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) ­ Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had<br>
    &nbsp;heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all<br>
    &nbsp;there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures<br>
    &nbsp;sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not<br>
    &nbsp;been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the Old Took died, in<br>
    &nbsp;fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. <br>
