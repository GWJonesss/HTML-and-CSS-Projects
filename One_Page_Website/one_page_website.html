                    <h3> #10 Michael Laudrup</h3>
                    <p>Michael Laudrup joined Barcelona because he adored Johan Cruyff when he growing up. <br> 
                        The Dane would become one of the most exciting footballers on Earth under his hero's tutelage <br>
                         before falling out with him and completing a controversial move to Real Madrid.But that shouldn't<br> 
                    take away from the fact that Laudrup was one of the most elegant and effortless footballers <br> 
                    of a generation in any position that he played. He was one of the most technically gifted of the Dream Team,<br> 
                    with vision, speed and passing that was on a different plain to so many of his contemporaries.<br>
                     Without him, Cruyff's side would maybe still have won four LaLigas, the European Cup <br>
                      and plaudits from all corners – but it would've felt a little emptier: like it was missing one of its <br> 
                      most influential artist's strokes from its canvas.</p>

                    <h3> #9 Cesar Rodriguez</h3>
                    <p>Cesar Rodriguez was perhaps Barcelona's very first superstar. He managed reach double-figures in<br>
                         goals in 11 seasons and whether he was helping keep the team in the league or leading them to <br>
                         titles, he was vital. A key member of the side that won five trophies in 1951/52, <br>
                         he managed to help drag Barca from the bottom to the top too, like no other player has done since:<br>
                        and reports say he dazzled, with an ability to score corners and a prolific touch <br>
                        that no one had ever seen in Catalonia. 232 goals in 351 appearances makes him <br>
                        one of the greatest to ever do it in Blaugrana colours. </p>

                    <p>He's maybe underrated, simply for his poor stint as manager but it's hard to imagine Barcelona in <br>
                        its modern form without Ronald Koeman. And not just because the Dutchman scored their first-ever<br>
                        European Cup win. A sweeper with unbelievable vision and incredible shooting from distance, <br>
                        Koeman is the top-scoring defender in world football with 90 goals in all competitions at Barca.<br>
                         He added style to Cruyff's team after signing from PSV and is quite simply one of the most outstanding <br>
                         all-round footballers to ever play. </p>

                    <h3> #7 Samuel Eto'o</h3>
                    <p>Samuel Eto'o was the complete striker. So few could be so deft on the ball, so intense off of it. <br>
                        And he was utterly perfect for Pep Guardiola: he helped inform the direction that the Catalan would go <br>
                         in with his attack. Widely considered the greatest African footballer ever, Eto'o had put Barca on his back <br>
                         long before Pep arrived, guiding them to the 2006 Champions League final and being the consistent spark <br>
                          of brilliance through the darker periods. He was an integral member of the front three he formed <br>
                          with Messi and Henry, too, showing the selflessness and intelligence to give the other two space when needed. </p>

                    <h3> #6 Diego Maradona</h3>
                    <p>He's arguably the greatest footballer of all time. He's worshipped at Boca Juniors and Napoli. <br>
                        But though Diego Maradona trashed the Camp Nou trophy room, got in fisticuffs with opposing players <br>
                        and didn't live up to his majestic heights at Barcelona, he's still one of the most otherworldly presences<br>
                          to ever grace their team. In just two years at Barca, he created moments to become mythologised: <br>
                          becoming the first player ever applauded by Real fans in a Clasico, reducing training sessions <br>
                           to the rest of the team standing and watching him and winning <br>
                          three cups in 1983. Maradona ensured that Barcelona was a place for the truly spectacular. <br>
                           His return of 38 goals in 58 Barca games isn't quite testament to quite how much genius he sewed <br>
                            in Spanish football. </p>

                    <h3> #5 Ronaldinho</h3>
                    <p>The showman Ronaldinho was the last of the Three R's to light up the Camp Nou. <br>
                         He did it quite unlike the other two. A £21m signing from PSG, Ronnie was expected to inject<br>
                          a bit of fun back into the Barca side – and though he was always there for <br>
                           a flick, a trick, a back-heel or even a hip wiggle (prior to that goal againt Chelsea), <br>
                           his output was hugely underrated. This wasn't just a performing seal from the Nike ads. <br>
                           Ronaldinho became one of the best playmakers on Earth during his time in Catalonia, <br>
                           leading Barca to their first Champions League trophy in 14 years in Paris and scooping a <br>
                           Ballon d'Or for good measure. He is still as adored now as he was back then. </p>

                    <h3> #4 Johan Cruyff</h3>
                    <p>Pundits, analysts and football nerds fawn over the Dream Team, the diamond midfield and Johan Cruyff's <br>
                         contribution to coaching so much that they sometimes forget just how much of a genius he was on the pitch.<br>
                        It's similar to how the Cruyff Turn is replayed at every World Cup – yet the flying backheel <br>
                        he scored to meet a cross with against Atletico Madrid is perhaps the greatest goal you've never seen. <br>
                        And the Dutchman was full of these moments. He had vision, versatility, guile, passing ability <br>
                        and the eye for something that no one had ever witnessed: he was quite simply one of a kind <br>
                        and the marriage of football's greatest artist with a city of such culture was a match made in heaven. <br>
                        Were it not for his on-pitch exploits, the history of Barcelona would look very different indeed. <br>
                        Johan Cruyff changed football – and the Camp Nou was blessed to be his stage for so many of <br>
                        his most wonderful moments. <br>
                        Just two trophies in his playing days there don't do justice to quite what a force he was. </p>

                    <p>"He has masterminded some of football's finest heists, but his fingerprints are rarely <br>
                        found at the scene," author Musa Okwonga once said of Andres Iniesta. It's the perfect <br>
                        description of a man who scored fewer goals at club level than John Terry.The Spaniard <br>
                        \first made himself known to European audiences by coming on in the 2006 Champions League final<br>
                         and changing the game. His directness, dribbling, touch and movement has become legendary,<br>
                          with mentor Pep Guardiola assessing that "his mastery of the relationship <br>
                           between space and time," is second to none. Because though Iniesta was rarely the full stop<br>
                            at the end of the move, he was everything that Cules hold dear.<br>
                             He was beautiful to watch, looked after the ball like his life depended on it and played the game<br>
                              with such grace that he made it look like ballet. Plenty have tried to replicate him: none ever truly will. </p>

                         A metronome of the game who was schooled in the Barcelona way from the age of 11 and stood <br> 
                         on top of the world to represent the club. Giving the ball to Xavi was basically a cheat code: <br>
                         he would unlock any defence with a feint, a shoulder drop and the most perfectly measured pass. <br>
                         His vision has become legendary that the fact that he so rarely relinquished possession <br>
                          has almost become underrated. Quite simply, he always put the ball in a better place <br>
                          than the place he received it. Jorge Valdano once said that "If football was a science,<br>
                           Xavi would have discovered the formula." There may never be a footballer with quite such a combination <br>
                            of intelligence, delicacy and awareness. He is the very model of everything the club aspire to.  </p>

            <h3>#1 Lionel Messi</h3>
            <p>
                The numbers of his career have to be seen to be believed. 672 goals in 778 appearances for Barcelona. <br>
                 228 assists on top of that. 10 domestic titles, four Champions Leagues, seven Ballon d'Ors, <br>
                  six European Golden Shoes and eight hat-tricks in Europe (a joint record with you know who). <br>
                We often talk of Messi's achievements through pure numbers – and perhaps that's how he sees the game, <br>
                crunching the angles as he glides through defenders. But it doesn't do justice to the magic that he's <br>
                 given to Barca fans along the way. The last-minute Clasico goal in which he held his shirt aloft <br>
                 at the Camp Nou. Putting Jerome Boateng on his backside. The Getafe goal. The move to false nine. <br>
                  The 2011 Champions League final performance. The countless moments he did something that no one else could.<br>
                  And that's just a few. He's not only Barcelona's greatest player ever, he's the most talented person to ever <br>
                   lace up their football boots, having changed the game one shoulder drop at a time. </p>
